I found Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS), a government contracted organization for separated immigrant children has always been a supporter for democrats, as they criticized the government for not taking enough responsibilities.

During the interview for the story about unaccompanied alien children, Danielle Bernard, the communications manager of LIRS criticized U.S. Health & Human Services (HHS) for not taking enough actions to take care of unaccompanied alien children. She also spoke against President Trump's "zero tolerance" immigration policy. However, as LIRS is a government funded agency, I wondered if what she said was true, or it was just her personal opinion. 

I took the following steps to verify my suspect:
1.	Searched the FEC website for donations in 2011- 2018 election cycle from employees of "Lutheran Immigration".  
Note: When I input “Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service”, no results popped up. But when I did “Lutheran Immigration,” results about the same organization came out.   
2.	Exported and integrated those results into one CVS file named "LIRS".  
Note: All donations went to two organizations: Act Blue and Earmark for Bernie 2016. The former supports democrats and the latter supports Senator Bernie Sanders, who returned to the Senate as an independent and endorsed Clinton in 2016.  
3.	Repeated the previous steps for the individual Danielle Bernard. 
Note: I didn’t find any donation from Danielle Bernard under the organization LIRS. However, I checked her profile and found that she worked as senior assistant director of digital communications in New York University from December 2012 to August 2017, before she started her job at LIRS. For all records under the name of Danielle Bernard, the two from 2015 to 2016 can be confirmed to be the one at LIRS now, based on her LinkedIn page. Two results from Dec. 9, 2017 are under an unemployed Danielle Bernard, which should not be the one I am looking at.   
4.	For the LIRS file:  
Made a pivot table with year, contribution recipient amount and contributor name to know the account of donators and the sum of donations each year and altogether.
5.	Integrated two files into one named “LIRS all” and repeated step4.

**Nut graph**: Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service (LIRS), a government contracted organization for separated immigrant children, wished its government partner U.S. Health & Human Services (HHS) “could have done more” for these kids. 
The LIRS, in favor of immigrants’ rights, has always been a support for democrats. Nine employees over the past seven years have donated 17 times, around 700 dollars for the Democratic Party.

I want to analyze why more and more Indian and China students, especially who have master degree, left the States after graduation. This is newsworthy because it shows the mobility trend of high skilled workers and the reason behind that. Last year saw the largest decline in the annual growth rate of foreign college graduates staying in U.S. to work. The reason can be political or economic.  

I will obtain the number of OPT, STEM, H1B approvals through U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (https://www.ice.gov/sevis/practical-training) via a public records request. If that takes time, I will also ask Pew Research Center(http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/07/25/number-of-foreign-college-graduates-staying-in-u-s-to-work-climbed-again-in-2017-but-growth-has-slowed/) for the data they have. To figure out the reason for the loss, I will ask around among Chinese and Indian graduates, and ask for government data, such as unemployment rates, accordingly.  

Here are several numbers I would visualize: the growth of foreign students who stayed year by year, China and India’s decline in growth (16-17 or year by year), the biggest contributor to the decline (such as the unemployment rates, or China and India’ GDP growth rates).  

This is timely because international students once again are in the application process of OPT/STEM. The story would give them an insight of what is happening. It’s also based on a newly released report by the Pew Research Center.  

I will talk to authors of the report at Pew, policy experts on OPT/STEM/H1B, Indian and Chinese master graduates, college employees at the career development office. After I got quotes from graduates, I will talk to related experts, such as economic experts, based on their answers.

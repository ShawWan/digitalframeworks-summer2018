# Assignment 2
Due date: July 18, 6 p.m.

1. Although the number of journalists killed declined from 2016, that of female journalists reached the highest since 2009, according to a report by the Committee to Protect Journalists in 2017. The rate of victimized female journalists more than doubled. Why was 2017 especially a dangerous year for female journalists? Was it because women journalists were targeted because of their gender? I am curious about the biggest contributor to this situation.

2. A list of the things you want to know about any data point:  
* Year (Data needs to be collected from at least 16 and 17. 18 can also be included),   
* name,   
* title,   
* organization, 
* coverage (Does a certain beat make journalists closer to death? ),   
* medium,   
* reason of death,   
* location of death (Is there a place more dangerous for female journalists than male journalists?),   
* gender,   
* country of origin( Are women journalists from a certain origin more likely to be killed?) ,   
* story about the death (more details about the reason why they died).  

3. I've found several organizations that have published databases on the topic "journalists killed," including the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the International News Safety Institute, the International Federation of Journalists, UNESCOâ€™s Intergovernmental Program for the Development of Communication and Reporters Without Borders. The problem is each of them has their own criteria in terms of who is a journalist or how journalists are confirmed dead. I will choose one as the base of my database and ask them for more information. The contact information of CPJ is 212-465-1004 and info@cpj.org. For the stories about their death, I will search them one by one. 

4. The table:

1. Delete unnecessary columns
2. Fix wrong names using "Find and Replace":  
√° -a  
≈ü -ş  
√±a - ñ  
√≥ - ó  
√ß -ç 
√£ -ã  
√© - é   
√∫ - ú  
√± -ñ  
√≠ - í  
≈Å - Ł  

3. Unmerge cells in the column "Year"

4. Add female column, because female journalists are my focus on the data

5. Replace blanks with "n/a"  
find-go to- special-blanks- does not work  
use auto filters instead- and use "go to blanks" to make sure there are no more blanks

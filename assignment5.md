**Is female journalists being targeted in certain countries?**  

2017 witnessed the loss of 9 females journalists, the highest for the past four years, when the totality declined. However, they were not targeted for their gender in places where they did reporting, because countries such as Syria showed no difference to male journalists as well.

### Questions:
1. Is 2017 the most deadly year for female journalists during the past four years?
2. What is the most dangerous place for female journalists? 
3. What is the most dangerous place for male journalists? Is there a gender difference?

### Cleaning data:
1. Download data of journalists killed from 2015-2018
2. Delete unnecessary columns
3. Fix wrong names using "Find and Replace"  
4. Add female column, because female journalists are my focus on the data
5. Replace blanks with "n/a"
find-go to- special-blanks- does not work
use auto filters instead- and use "go to blanks" to make sure there are no more blanks
6. Create two seprate sheets with "Female" and "Male" using data filter, because we need to analyze them separately

### Analyzing data: 
**1. Is 2017 the most deadly year for female journalists during the past four years?**

**Steps:**   
Data filter- select all the Y under Female column- using Pivetchart to have the numbers of female journalists who died every year  
**Answers:**    
In 2017, 9 female journalists died. It is the highest during the past four years. However, it's only one more compared with that of 2015. 


**2. What is the most dangerous place for female journalists?**

**Steps:**  
Female sheet- Pivetchart (year, count of country, count of primary nationality, count of female journalists who died)  
**Answers:**   
During the past four years, there is no significant difference in terms of dangerous level in reporting countries or females journalists' nationalities. Only in 2015, South Sudan was responsible for two deaths. This indicates that female journalists were not targeted in certain countries and their death was not that much related with their origins.


**3. What is the most dangerous place for male journalists? Is there a gender difference?**  

**Steps:**    
Male sheet-Pivetchart (year, count of country, count of male journalist who died)  
**Answers:**    
In 2015, the most dangerous places for male journalists are Syria (12), France (8), and Iraq (6). In 2016, it's Syria (14), Yemen (6), and Iraqu (6). In 2017, it's Syria (7), Iraqu (5), and Mexico (5). In 2018, it's Afhganistan (9), Syria (6), Mexico and U.S. (3). Based on these numbers, Syria has always been a place deadly for male journalists. 
Compared with results from question 2, there is a gender difference  between the number of journalists killed all around the world. But we can't come to the conclusion that female journalists were targeted in certain countries.
